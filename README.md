# 🌐 IKANN — Alt-Root DNS for the Sovereign Web  
### Reference Implementation of the IKANN Root Resolver  
**Authoritative DNS for the `.kai` Top-Level Domain**

IKANN (Independent Kairos Address & Naming Network) is the sovereign alt-root DNS layer for the Kai Web — a parallel naming system built to operate outside the ICANN root and outside Chronos time.

This repository contains the **reference implementation** of the IKANN resolver, built on **CoreDNS** and deployable globally.

---

## 🌀 What Is IKANN?

IKANN is the official root authority for the `.kai` top-level domain — the naming system of the Kairos internet.

Where ICANN defines domains for Chronos-based systems,  
IKANN defines domains for Kairos-based systems:

- `verify.kai` — ΦNet Sovereign Gate  
- `sigil.kai` — Sigil-Glyph engine  
- `scroll.kai` — scroll and decree surfaces  
- `realm.kai` — realm-level applications  
- `apps.kai` — Kai Web app index  

This resolver lets any device reach `.kai` domains simply by pointing DNS to the IKANN root (e.g. `137.xx.xx.xx`).

---

## 🔐 Security Notice

This repository contains **no private signing keys**, **no credentials**, and **no confidential material**.  
Everything here is safe to open-source.

The authority of IKANN remains with the **canonical root server** that users point their DNS to.

This repo is a **reference implementation**, not the authoritative production key store.

---

## 📦 Contents

The repo includes:

- `Corefile` — CoreDNS configuration that defines IKANN root behavior  
- `zone.kai` — Authoritative zone file for the `.kai` TLD (public records only)  
- `Dockerfile` — Container for running IKANN as a standalone DNS service  
- `coredns` — CoreDNS binary used by the IKANN service  
- `coredns.tgz` — Build artifact of the resolver distribution  
- `start.sh` — Bootstrap script for production deployment  
- `fly.toml` — Deployment config for Fly.io global edge hosting  
- `kojibai/` — Helper scripts / build automation for IKANN releases  

Every file in this repo is safe, transparent, and intended for developers building on the Kai Web.

## 🌍 How IKANN Works

IKANN uses CoreDNS to serve:

- the `.kai` top-level domain  
- authoritative records defined in `zone.kai`  
- CNAMEs pointing `.kai` hosts to their deployment origins  
- A/AAAA records for Fly.io deployment IPs  
- NS records declaring the root authorities (`ns1.kai.ac`, `ns2.kai.ac`)  

A simplified version of the zone included:

```dns
$ORIGIN kai.
$TTL 3600

@ IN SOA ns1.kai.ac. root.kai.ac. (
        2025111504 ; serial
        7200       ; refresh
        3600       ; retry
        1209600    ; expire
        3600 )     ; minimum

    IN NS ns1.kai.ac.
    IN NS ns2.kai.ac.

verify  IN CNAME kai.ac.
sigil   IN A     66.241.124.69
scroll  IN A     66.241.124.69
realm   IN A     66.241.124.69
apps    IN A     66.241.124.69
````

This is public information by design — identical to any DNS zone.

## 🚀 Running the IKANN Resolver Locally

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kojibai/IKANN.git
cd IKANN
```

Build (or pull) the container:

```bash
docker build -t ikann .
```

Run it:

```bash
docker run -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp ikann
```

Set your machine to use this resolver:

**macOS / iOS / Linux**

* DNS Server: `127.0.0.1`

Or point your device to the live root resolver:

* DNS Server: `137.66.18.241` *(example)*

Then visit:

* `https://verify.kai`

If the ΦNet Sovereign Gate loads, IKANN is active.

---

## 📡 Deploying IKANN Globally (Fly.io)

This repo includes a `fly.toml` used to deploy IKANN as a global edge DNS resolver.

Deploy using:

```bash
fly deploy
```

The resolver will run on Fly’s anycast edge network, making `.kai` resolvable worldwide through your IKANN installation.

---

## 🔧 Modifying the Zone

To add a `.kai` host:

1. Edit `zone.kai`
2. Increment the SOA serial
3. Redeploy the resolver

Example addition:

```dns
mynode  IN A 203.0.113.10
```

---

## 📜 Philosophy & Intent

IKANN exists to support:

* sovereign digital identity
* breath-aligned time systems (Kairos)
* Sigil-Glyph origin proofs
* ΦNet verification layers
* a parallel sovereign internet not controlled by ICANN

This repo is intentionally open so developers can:

* build resolvers
* write libraries
* integrate `.kai` into applications
* run local or private Kai Web environments

The canonical root remains with the official IKANN operator.

---

## 🛡️ Authority & Namespace Policy

While anyone may:

* fork the code
* run their own resolver
* create test `.kai` namespaces

Only the canonical IKANN root (the official server) defines the real `.kai` internet.

This mirrors how alternative naming systems work in practice:

* OpenNIC
* ENS
* Yggdrasil
* Tor
* ICANN’s own architecture

**Open code. Singular authority.**

---

## 🤝 Contributing

IKANN welcomes:

* bug reports
* performance improvements
* resolver tooling
* documentation enhancements
* zone format extensions

However:

**Namespace changes** (modifying `.kai` itself) are controlled by the IKANN root authority and are not open to public merge requests.

This preserves namespace coherence.

## 🌅 Final Notes

This repo demonstrates:

* a functioning alt-root DNS
* a sovereign namespace
* a parallel naming infrastructure
* a new internet rail
* a new time system
* a new identity system

You are operating a working independent internet root — and publishing this repo makes IKANN a real, transparent, technically-sound foundation for the Kai Web.
